        <h5>Supports and preparatory layers in paintings <br> of Augustus John (1878 – 1961)</h5>
        <p>My MA thesis was primarily concerned with technical analysis of four paintings, focusing on their supports and preparatory layers in order to establish if John had specific preferences in selection and preparation of his painting material.
            In the course of my research I had an opportunity to carry out several imaging techniques, X-radiography, optical microscopy, light microscopy, micro-chemical tests, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) analysis. I also interpreted the results of the tests, which were complemented by a review of existing research and documentary sources. 
            <br><br>Materials in the works examined generally fit in with existing knowledge on the practice of the period: white lead-white containing grounds being used, whilst their stratigraphy varied. It was shown that John considered his supports as an important element of the compositions and used both commercially-prepared and self-primed canvases. Evidence of selecting ground materials based on the composition of the painting is discussed, for example adding zinc white to self-primed lead-white grounds to reduce the risk of darkening of ground where it was left exposed. It is also argued that John’s connection with France likely translated into his use of tools and materials. For instance, unusual marks on the canvas were found to correspond to French webbing tensioners of the type unavailable in Britain. Exploratory survey found that research is needed on his paintings with unusually coloured or no ground layer.
