            <h5>Condition surveys</h5>
            <h6>Collection survey at Guildhall Art Gallery <em>June 2017</em></h6>
            <p>I participated in a project aiming at surveying the City of London’s Collection of Paintings, digitising the documentation and uploading data onto the new Collections Management System (MuseumIndex+).
              I worked in a small team for two weeks, during which we condition checked almost 100 paintings and uploaded the data on to the database. I assessed their suitability for display and loan, and estimated the time required for conservation work. An important aspect of the project was the digitalisation of the object through digital photography of the paintings. I also cleaned existing data (which had been migrated from a previous system to the new CMS) and investigated any discrepancies between the actual location of paintings on racks and that listed on the database.
            </p>

            <h6>Condition reporting for exhibitions at Tyne and Wear Museums (TWAM) <em>2016-18</em></h6>
            <p>In my two years as a conservation volunteer at TWAM  I assisted with a busy programme of exhibitions which required unpacking, installation and condition checking of large volumes of objects by tight deadlines. The exhibitions in which I assisted include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><em>The Making of an Englishman</em> (June 2018)<br>
  Oil paintings on canvas and board by German émigré artist Fred Uhlman.</li>
  <li><em>Enchanted Garden </em> (June 2018)<br>
  Exhibition of paintings from ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites to 20th century abstraction. </li>
  <li><em>Glenn Bown: Fantasy Landscapes, Portraits and Beasts </em> (June 2018)<br>
              
      New paintings by Glenn Brown. Assessment of objects pre-selected for the exhibition. </li>
      <li><em>The Heart of the Matter </em>(March 2018)<br>
      Installation of an exhibition featuring printed calico and textiles, installations and sculpture. </li>
      <li><em>Sean Scully: 1970</em> (February 2018)<br>
      Retrospect of Scully, featuring large-scale, unframed paintings in the style of post-minimalist abstraction.</li>
